"Greetings Starfighter." I remember those words like the first time my dad
showed me the old arcade game.

Notes:

* The main character is Logan's daughter (From the last starfighter), who grew
  up to be a starfighter pilot.

* After TLS movie, Logan/Maggie returned to earth to start a starfighter pilot
  training programme and include Earth, reluctantly, into whatever that
  federation is.  They were low on starfighter pilots, and it turns out
  although humans aren't as technologically advanced, they were far enough
  the flight tree that they were fast tracked into being pilots.

* .. but, earth itself wasn't ready yet (think early 80's reagan USA,
  thatcher, middle east, USSR, etc) and once earth got a big tech tree upgrade,
  it went through a brutal civil war, and the starfighter pilots / families
  were quickly relocated off-world.

* So, that's where Logan's daughter grew up.  Off world, seeing earth fight
  itself.

* Logan / Maggie didn't like it, and returned to try and help fight back,
  but were killed in the fighting.

* Who came out on top?  No specific country.  More, the worst violent
  authoritarian government combination came out on top, suppressing everyone
  and everything else, and establishing a replacement UN style ruling council.

* .. and then they started turning their sights to conquering the rest of
  the local corner of the galaxy.

* So, the story starts with the daughter dictating a diary entry, thinking
  back to her mum and dad.  It turns out that she and her co-pilot were in
  a starfighter, heading towards Earth, trying to push humanity back from
  invading outward.
